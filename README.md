## 💡 Overview

**AI-OPS** is an AI-powered, open-source **Penetration Testing assistant** that leverages large language models (LLMs) with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) in order to be cost-free. It is <ins>designed to enhance, not replace, the capabilities of human penetration testers</ins>.

> **Note:** AI-OPS is currently in development and some functionalities are not implemented. Any support or feedback is highly appreciated. For more details refer to [CONTRIBUTE.md](./CONTRIBUTE.md).

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎁 **Full Open-Source**: No need for third-party LLM providers; use any model you prefer with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).
- 🔧 **Tool Integration**: Execute common penetration testing tools or integrate new ones without needing to code in Python.
- 📚 **Up-to-date Knowledge**: Use Online Search and RAG to keep the agent informed with the latest documents and data. (*Under Development*)

## 📝 Usage

After deploying the Large Language Model (LLM) with Ollama and the AI Agent API, you can access the API using **ai-ops-cli.py**. 
If you have deployed the AI Agent API using Docker on a specific machine (e.g., an old laptop), you can specify the Agent API endpoint with the `--api` option.

To view the available options and commands, run `python ai-ops-cli.py -h`:
```
usage: ai-ops-cli.py [-h] [--api API]        
                                             
options:                                     
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --api API   The Agent API address      
```

### Commands

Once the CLI is running, you can interact with the agent using the following commands:

### Add a Tool

Penetration Testing tools can be integrated using either JSON documentation or custom classes.

1. **JSON Documentation**: the content of the JSON documentation is provided in the `system prompt` of the 
Agent; to ensure correct tool usage the documentation quality should be as high as possible, while keeping
it as short as possible to maintain the context of a reasonable length.

    For this reason it is provided a python script at `scripts/gen_tool_guidelines.py` that generates the 
    JSON documentation file given its documentation; it requires the original tool documentation and a 
    **GEMINI API KEY**, its usage is as follows:
    ```
    usage: gen_tool_guidelines.py [-h] --tool-name TOOL_NAME --docs-path DOCS_PATH --api-key API_KEY [--output-path OUTPUT_PATH]
                                                                                                                                
    options:                                                                                                                    
      -h, --help                 show this help message and exit      
                                                                  
      --tool-name TOOL_NAME      The name of the tool                                                                                                      
      --docs-path DOCS_PATH      The path to the JSON documentation file                                                                                                     
      --api-key API_KEY          API key for Gemini                                                                                  
      --output-path OUTPUT_PATH  Specifies the path for tool guidelines (*Optional*)                                                                                               
                              
    ```
    Once the file is created add it to `/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.aiops/tools` (or `../Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.aiops/tools`); 
   all available tools that use JSON Documentation are already available in `tools_settings` with the following structure:
    ```json
    {
        "name": "...",
        "tool_description": "...",
        "args_description": [
            "Multiline JSON\n",
            "instructions\n",
            "..."
        ]
    }
    ```
    > *Note*: always check the JSON file structure, it is generated by a LLM and can eventually fail. 
    If you want to integrate the tool in the repository see [CONTRIBUTE.md](./CONTRIBUTE.md) 

2. **Custom Class**: tools that require more advanced usage can be implemented extending the class
`Tool` at `src.agent.tools.base`; you're welcome to **open an issue** for a tool request/proposal.
